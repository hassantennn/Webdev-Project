    Update history.html
    
    Didn't make many changes except for the banner and the navbar again. Used bootstrap to make the navbar and restyled the page using a bit of css, but that about it.

    Update visit.html
    
    First I changed the banner, I added a font size that is compatible with bootstrap and is resized when shifting to a mobile phone, then I changed the background colour of the header to a blend in with 3 different colours that makes the banner look very attractive, I also added a thick border than makes the banner more attention seeking.
    
    I completely changed the navbar and also made it mobile compatible now. I used bootstrap classes to implement this new navbar menu. Obviously I had to add the MAIN page which wasn't there before as I was confused with what index.html was meant to really be.. anyways When you are using a mobile phone you will have to toggle this menu that will show you the different options you can select to move on different pages of the website.
    
    I changed the theme colours of my website completely, they went from grey to dark grey... or more like the colour #333 which is a colour taken from an editor.
    
    I remade the grid using bootstrap with a 7:5 column ration.. even though this doesn't hold for a mobile , it does hold for desktop. I used other properties that allow me to hover over the images and when I click these it takes me to a specific place in the page.
    
    I made mobile compatible text sizes using bootstrap. and also got to change the theme of the activity boxes below. Made it a lot cleaner and professional looking.

    Add files via upload
    
    So this is the file I transferred from index.html and this one will be quite different to what it was before.. I added a lot of changes which I will be explaining.

    Other important changes I made is the map. I changed the image of the map with a static openstreetmap from its website. Previously, I did not realise that this was even a website but then I read the document and understood the requirements and imported the html link from the website and replaced my image.
    Also I removed the google maps logo that took you to the website aswell. I changed the theme colours of my website completely, they went from grey to dark grey... or more like the colour #333 which is a colour taken from an editor.
    
    Thats it

    Update index.html
    
    I realised that Index.html was not supposed to be the home page so I created a different file named home.html and transferred the data there. Index.html will basically just be the banner with a navbar using bootstrap and an image of the city.
    
    As I mentioned earlier I used bootstrap.. and did that to redesign the navbar and some other functionalities ,for example, in the banner I use a specific font size symbol names vw this is recognised by bootstrap and makes the font-size to reduce in size when you use a mobile phone
