# This is the WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT that was based on creating a website about our hometown

In this file I will be basically explaining my experience in having coded this website and how did I get to tackle these problems and come up with an efficient solution.

First of all I came up with a very basic Html document structure, putting in a h1 tag and other very basic tags that I would further be styling. Now, obviously I used css but I did so in the same file using style tags inside the head tags inside my html file, rather than creating a different file and then linking it in.

Using css, I had to style the banner... I made it very simple at first, having added some padding, a decent fontsize and other style tags to make the file look pleasant. I implemented a navbar with html and css only, including a little logo to make it fancy.

At this stage, I was facing a challenge and that was about not knowing how many pages I had to include. This was completely my fault, as I didn't read the file properly, but anyways at the beginnning I was utilising a total of 3 .html documents leaving one of them uncreated. I got confused because I thought index.html and home page were supposed to be the same page. 

So what I did for the navbar was that at the beginnig I used purely html and css to style and implement it. But as I moved forward, not only I added the addition missing document, but I also used bootstrap to re-implement it. This was quite big of a challenge and it took me a while to understand. I had to go over the slides and revise to first get an understanding and then implement my navbar functioning correctly

The history page was a mess aswell, I had wanted to implent the boxes, with two being next to each other. At the beginning, I couldn't figure out how to use the display and flex properties to make this work, but after a long time of experimenting and revising the modules I got it working

Later on, I proceded to completely change my home page, as I did not find it pleasing enough. I did not like the colours, neither I liked how the website was looking 20 years older than it should have. So I changed the colours and used a much more modern approach to style my home page, using different bootstrap properties for the banner, the sections with the paragraphs and adding big images that showcase different places of the city.

The visit page was the trickiest one of them all, the hardest part was to figure out how to make a grid system with bootsrap, once I got that done I had to implement the page further so whenever I clicked in any of the images in the grid, the page automatically takes me to the correct section of this same page. This seemed like a creative approach to me to make the website responsive and interactive.

There is a section where I basically revised every piece of code, as well as having used bootstrap to change most of the theme of the website. This was not the hardest part of the assignment, but it certainly was long enough to take several hours of my days. I changed the theme of the website, used different colours, I changed the banner using bootstrap to make it mobile friendly.. I also added a map from openmapstreet instead of just using an image, I made a mistake of just adding an image at the beginning, because again i misread the assignment requirements.
